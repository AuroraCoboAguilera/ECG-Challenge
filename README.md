# ECG-Challenge
This is the repository to solve the ECG Challenge for Idoven.

You may interpret this project as a work from a person who has never dealt with ECG data, with limited time execution and resources limitations too. In any case, I express in the notebook different solutions I would try in another situation with the previous issues solved.

I hope you enjoy this work. Any doubt -> a.cobo.aguilera@gmail.com
